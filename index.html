             <h1> Page 1: Wage and Salary Employment Rate by Gender in the World </h1>
             This scene shows the discrepancy in worldwide workers that are wage and salaried workers as a percentage of total employment. <br/>
             There are a few key takeaways:
             <ol>
               <li> The overall trend is that the percentage of wage and salaried workers has been increasing across both genders. </li>
               <li> I had expected that the percentage of women workers would be lower than the percentage of male workers, but this chart shows the opposite to be true worldwide. </li>
             </ol>

             <h1> Page 2: Wage and Salary Employment Rate by Gender in the US </h1>
             This scene shows the discrepancy between wage and salaried workers in the USA. <br/>
             There are a few key takeaways: 
             <ol>
               <li> As it is worldwide, the overall trend is that the percentage of wage and salaried workers has been increasing across both genders. </li>
               <li> The percentage of women workers is still higher than the percentage of male workers, as it is worldwide. This is interesting because there is still a gender pay gap, causing women to be paid less, but more women are actually working. </li>
               <li> The percentages (y-axis) of working people across both genders is much higher than the world population. </li>
             </ol>
